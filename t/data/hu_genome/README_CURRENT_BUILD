Celera          Celera Genomics whole genome shotgun assembly (AADB),
                November 2001. This assembly included both WGS and BAC
                sequence data. 
HuRef           J Craig Venter Institute whole genome shotgun assembly
                (May 2007) (see http://www.jcvi.org/research/huref/). 
                This assembly represents a composite haploid version 
                of the diploid genome sequence from a single 
                individual (J. Craig Venter).
CRA_TCAGchr7v2  The Center for Applied Genomics at the Hospital for
                Sick Children (Toronto) chromosome 7 assembly, (April
                2004). 
DR53            DR53 haplotype for the MHC region on chromosome 6.
c5_H2           An alternate assembly for part of chromosome 5.
c6_COX          An alternate haplotype assembly of the chromosome 6
                MHC region based on sequence data from the COX
                library.  
c6_QBL          An alternate haplotype assembly of the chromosome 6
                MHC region based on sequence data from the QBL
                library.
