This directory is antique. It is just for those people who have problems with the OTF-files. Please mail me, if neither TTF nor OTF files of Libertine work on your computer! In the next version I would otherwise not produce dfonts anymore.

These dfont-files can be used on Macintosh computers if they don't accept the TrueTypes. I've been told that new versions of MacOSX would support the TTF-versions. You are free to use what is best for you. 
Note: The dfont-files in the directory need not to be the same release-version as the fonts in parent directory. It takes me much time to keep these fils recompiled for every version, especially when not even all Mac-Users need the dfonts.
Besides: I have no Mac and can't test this font.
