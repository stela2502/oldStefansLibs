LinuxLibertine for LaTex is in progress. 
You may have a look at following PDF-document: http://www.dante.de/dante/events/mv35/programm/niedermair/niedermair-font-libertine.pdf
Some people already told me that in some LaTex distributions the ordinary OTF can be used.

For restless people and other playing geeks :-) Have a look at the following suggestions:

I've been told that there are different ways how LinuxLibertine can be used with Latex. Have a view at http://linuxlibertine.sf.net and follow Tobias' link. 
There should be a description. If you are unsatisfied and need a special compilation a can easily do for you, let me know about it.
Alternativley, I copied a manual from that site into this directory: LibertinelnConTex.txt
I've heard something like this would also be practical: 
\usepackage[font=libertine]{opentype}
Try it out and write me, what you experienced.
