These are hinted version of LinuxLibertine. The only interested group should be Windows-users. Better seems to me even for Windows-Systems the use of the Opentype-variant *.otf (parent directory) 
Please mail me if you think those hinted TTFs are absolutely important for you. Otherwise the next version might not contain this subdirectory anymore...
